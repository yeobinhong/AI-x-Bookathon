The Boys of Wexford(더 보이즈 어브 웩스퍼드)는 아일랜드의 포크송이다. 켈리 더 보이 프럼 킬란(Kelly, the Boy From Killane), 불라보그(Boulavogue) 등의 포크송을 작사한 패트릭 조지프 매콜(1861~1919)이 작사하였고, 아서 워렌 딜리(1873~1929)가 작곡하였다. 웩스퍼드(Wexford)는 1798년의 아일랜드 독립 전쟁 때 처음 봉기가 일어난 곳이다. 이 곡은 아일랜드계인 미국 35대 대통령 존 피츠제럴드 케네디의 애창곡이기도 하다. 가사는 다음과 같다. (Chorus): We are the boys of Wexford, Who fought with heart and hand To burst in twain the galling chain And free our native land. In comes the captain's daughter, The captain of the Yeos, Saying "Brave United Irishmen, We'll ne'er again be foes. A thousand pounds I'll bring If you will fly from home with me, And dress myself in man's attire And fight for liberty." I want no gold, my maiden fair, To fly from home with thee. You shining eyes will be my prize, More dear than gold to me. I want no gold to nerve my arm To do a true man's part - To free my land I'd gladly give The red drops of my heart." And when we left our cabins, boys, We left with right good will To see our friends and neighbours That were at Vinegar Hill! A young man from our Irish ranks A cannon he let go; He slapt it into Lord Mountjoy A tyrant he laid low! We bravely fought and conquered At Ross and Wexford town; And if we failed to keep them, 'Twas drink that brought us down. We had no drink beside us On Tubberneering's day, Depending on the long, bright pike, And well it worked that way. And Oulart's name shall be their shame, Whose steel we ne'er did fear. For every man could do his part Like Forth and Shelmalier! And if for want of leaders, We lost at Vinegar Hill, We're ready for another fight, And love our country still! 1798년 독립 전쟁을 소재로, 아일랜드의 민족 감정을 자극하고 있다.
